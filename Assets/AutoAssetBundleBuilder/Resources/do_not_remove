// This file is here simply to prevent Git being unhappy about empty folders.
// During a build, this folder DOES contain a file temporarily that holds the 
// version and platform strings, for use when the player first starts up.
// But to prevent a ton of unnecessary lingering files being modified all the time,
// that file is added and removed during the build process.  Trying to keep it clean.  :-)
